# Notes

- Chose Vite because this is a SPA. Could have choosen Next but project is too simple for that, it doesn't need its ecosystem
- <select> element needs a value attribute in React to track its value
- use [Tanstack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to handle the API call to the instructed endpoint, instead of using the browser native fetch with `useEffect`,
